Our project is aimed towards developing a sophisticated program that specializes in converting audio speech to text, with a primary focus on accurately handling various accents. The motivation behind this endeavor is to pioneer an enhanced model that can significantly improve the capabilities of systems like Siri and Alexa, enabling them to adeptly interpret spoken English across diverse accent variations.
