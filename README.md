Our project is aimed towards developing a sophisticated program that specializes in converting audio speech to text, with a primary focus on accurately handling various accents. The motivation behind this endeavor is to pioneer an enhanced model that can significantly improve the capabilities of systems like Siri and Alexa, enabling them to adeptly interpret spoken English across diverse accent variations.

Data Set: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rtatman/speech-accent-archive

### Pre-requisites
* Python 3.0 or above
* pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

Install the following libraries on your IDE before running our code.
Libraries used:
* os
* zipfile
* pandas
* matplotlib
* librosa
* numpy
* torch
* sklearn-learn
* transformers
* IPython
* ipywidgets
* warnings
* string

### Usage Instructions:
For ease of use, follow these steps to run the FinalCode based on your preferred environment:

1. **Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Download and open `FinalCode.ipynb`.
   - Execute the notebook cells sequentially to run the code.
   - The program will automatically download required files from the Kaggle Dataset and utilize the improved model.

2. **Python IDE**:
   - Download `FinalCode (Python Code).py`.
   - Open and run the Python script using your preferred IDE (e.g., PyCharm, VSCode).
   - Ensure necessary dependencies are installed (check installation list).
   - The script will handle file downloads from the Kaggle Dataset and execute the program with the improved model.

**Disclaimer** The CodeCheckPoint files represent historical progress snapshots of our coding work and are no longer relevant for review. In contrast, within the speech_accent_dataset folder, you'll discover a comprehensive set of resources. This includes a detailed .csv file documenting individual speaker information, a .txt file containing the common passage used for all speakers' readings, and a recordings folder containing all corresponding mp3 files of these readings.
